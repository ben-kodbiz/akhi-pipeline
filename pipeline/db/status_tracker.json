      "channel": "Nouman Ali Khan - Official - Bayyinah",
      "description": "Watch the full reflection now of Surah Al-Mursalat on Bayyinah TV: https://byna.tv/106.\n\nIn this snippet of a Deeper Look of Surah Al-Mursalat, Ustadh Nouman Ali Khan unpacks the layered imagery described in the opening of the surah. What begins with a reference to winds quickly expands into a powerful scene of divine control, through winds, angels and even horses. Drawing on the Arab\u2019s deep connection with horses, Ustadh brings the verses to life by showing how Allah uses familiar symbols to awaken deeper truths.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a description of nature, it\u2019s a warning. Winds, which we often take for granted, are shown as instruments of divine judgment and mercy. The episode also explores the idea of spiritual obedience and the unseen deployment of Allah\u2019s armies.\n\nFrom battlefield logistics to shifting winds, the Quran calls humanity to recognize their dependence and their delusion when they think they are in control.\n------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udcda Start your Quran journey at https://www.bayyinahtv.com\n\ud83c\udf81 Sponsor a soul who seeks the Quran with a Bayyinah TV membership at https://bayyinah.com/gift",
