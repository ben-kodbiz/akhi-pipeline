People say, how do you get tukwa of Allah? Allah says, okay, start fasting and in month of Ramadan, and what's it going to give you? La alaikum tata wa wa wa sallam, how's fasting going to give me tukwa? Well, you're going to learn to stay away from things that are even halal. And it's going to teach you how to stop yourself and tukwa in the end is what? Stop yourself. So 30 days of stopping yourself might help you build a little bit of an ability to stop yourself. If you can even stop yourself from halal things, then maybe that's a pretty good training for you to even stop from? Haran things. And it's not guaranteed, la alaikum means hopefully you'll get some tukwa out of it. The hope is you'll get tukwa out of it. Okay, well, how do I know if I have tukwa? He says, tukwa, Allah, wa kuulu konan, sadida. Be mindful of Allah and say things in a straightforward way. Just say exactly what you mean. What happens sometimes when you need to talk to somebody? Do you say exactly what you mean? Or do you calculate in your head if I say this, what's going to happen? Oh my god. I hate me so much. I can't tell him. I can't tell him. No, I need to be strategic about this. We have so much fear of people that it overrides the fear of who. Plus if you have to love me, speak straightforward. Doesn't matter who you offend. Doesn't matter if you ended up siding with the enemy because you're saying the right thing. Doesn't matter if you were going against the loved one because you're siding with the right thing. If you're really fearful of me, just say the right thing. And then I will fix whatever situation there is. In other words, Allah does not give us some, oh, you must first climb on this mountain. And you must sit under a tree and until you feel the breeze, you will not know the truth of tukwa. There's no complicated stuff. It's straightforward. Tukwa is easy. You want to clean your heart? Easy. Don't do riba. They're complicated. Don't talk about people. Those slander people. Don't make fun of each other. Give people's money back. But you know what? Sometimes what happens is the thing that you should do that's right in your face that tukwa is saying, do this and you will be spiritually cleansed. That's too much work. So I'm going to come up with some vicar that makes me feel so spiritually connected. And when I read, when I listen to this machine, oh my god, I feel like so close to Allah. You come up with all these exotic ways of purifying your heart. And the thing that",

Something so special that this mentor of mine who knows the secrets of the universe apparently, he's going to tell me those secrets. Then I will know how to cleanse my heart. This stuff, I believe, is what used to be the case before the coming of the Quran. This thing that some people carry the secrets to cleanse your heart and nobody else knows them. This was the mentality before Islam. This is what people that used to manipulate people in the name of religion used to do. You know, a young lady asked the other day, I feel so bad that I don't fast on Mondays and Thursdays. Did Allah and his entire Quran ask you to feel bad if you don't fast on Mondays and Thursdays? Didn't he free you from that burden? There are some things you should feel bad about. And I'm pretty sure Allah, the knower of the unseen and the scene who guided humanity until the end of time with his most perfect speech, would tell you here are the things you should actually feel bad about. Right? So didn't he liberate me from all the other guilts that I don't have to carry? His lip is actually spiritually liberating.",
