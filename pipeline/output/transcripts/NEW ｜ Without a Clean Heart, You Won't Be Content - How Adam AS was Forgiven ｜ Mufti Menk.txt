[01:40.01 - 01:41.39] Speaker 2:  سنكم

[01:41.39 - 01:42.39] Speaker 2:  ستأحمها

[01:42.39 - 01:50.87] Speaker 2:  السلام. so what happened is Allah Almighty knew what His plan was. He wanted human beings to come

[01:50.87 - 01:58.91] Speaker 2:  on earth and He wanted them all to be related to one another. Amazing. If I were to tell you

[01:58.91 - 02:5.45] Speaker 2:  some of you are more closely related to me than others but all of you are related not just to

[02:5.45 - 02:12.42] Speaker 2:  me but to one another. It's just that you don't know the exact grandfather who was the same person

[02:12.74 - 02:22.43] Speaker 2:  but we were all and we are all related. So Allah wanted to do something amazing and Allah knows

[02:22.43 - 02:31.05] Speaker 2:  why. So Allah created the souls, Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala decided He's going to make one body

[02:31.05 - 02:39.07] Speaker 2:  and from that body He will create a spouse and from the two of them it will result in a multitude

[02:39.07 - 03:9.44] Speaker 2:  of men and women to disperse over the whole globe as you and I witnessed today. So listen to the

[03:9.44 - 03:22.29] Speaker 2:  one is Allah says O people, be conscious of the one who is in supreme control of your existence,

[03:22.55 - 03:30.61] Speaker 2:  the one who made you, the one who provides for you, your hub, be conscious of Him. He is the one

[03:30.61 - 03:38.29] Speaker 2:  what did He do, who created you from a single soul, created from it, its spouse and from the two of them

[03:38.29 - 03:46.79] Speaker 2:  caused a multitude of men and women to be throughout the earth. Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala did this

[03:46.79 - 03:59.46] Speaker 2:  for a reason he knew and he knows. But something very sad and very difficult, very different happened

[04:0.28 - 04:7.42] Speaker 2:  because when Allah created Adam he was lonely. When he was lonely he asked Allah to remove the loneliness

[04:7.42 - 04:14.10] Speaker 2:  why was he lonely? He was lonely because he was the only one of his species. Imagine if you

[04:14.10 - 04:20.14] Speaker 2:  live in a home or alone, may Allah make it easy for you. It's not so easy. When you're staying

[04:20.14 - 04:26.16] Speaker 2:  all alone and you've got no one with you, what happens? You feel lonely and you say oh Allah take

[04:26.16 - 04:32.18] Speaker 2:  my loneliness away. Ask those who are trying to get married and they can't get married, may Allah bless you

[04:32.18 - 04:39.74] Speaker 2:  with the spouse that will be the coolness of your eyes, say I mean. I always say why are the married

[04:39.74 - 04:47.87] Speaker 2:  guys saying I mean so loudly? We've got a problem, may Allah bless us. But nonetheless on a more

[04:47.87 - 04:54.85] Speaker 2:  serious note my brothers and sisters it's important to realize loneliness is something that Allah did not

[04:54.85 - 05:2.89] Speaker 2:  create us for. Unfortunately we have to endure it but Allah wants us to find a spouse to actively look

[05:2.89 - 05:8.01] Speaker 2:  for one. Whether it is simply Nikah or whatever it is we have brother Shana here this evening

[05:8.01 - 05:15.19] Speaker 2:  Mashallah and no matter what it is we must make an effort our family members, our sisters, our brothers

[05:15.19 - 05:22.97] Speaker 2:  whoever it is, try to match them, try to introduce someone to them, try to see, to get married,

[05:23.21 - 05:32.70] Speaker 2:  try to look into it and you know what I say to the people always, I say don't look for certain

[05:32.70 - 05:39.52] Speaker 2:  qualities when you know you don't have the qualities that that type of a person would be looking for.

[05:40.26 - 05:46.22] Speaker 2:  I hope you understood that it means I want a person who is praying I want him to be handsome I want him to be

[05:46.22 - 05:54.00] Speaker 2:  wealthy I want him to be dressed in a smart way I want to be him to be living within a 50 mile radius of me

[05:54.00 - 06:0.70] Speaker 2:  I want him to be of this and I want him to whatever guess what that guy is there. I can show you who he is

[06:0.70 - 06:6.59] Speaker 2:  but the problem is he's not looking for someone like you. That's the problem. Do you get what I'm saying?

[06:7.09 - 06:15.99] Speaker 2:  So what's the solution? Make yourself a person whom the person whom you would be looking for would be looking for

[06:15.99 - 06:25.31] Speaker 2:  simple. May Allah make it easy. May Allah grant us all he is. So going back to Adam Alayhi selam he was lonely. He says oh Allah take away my loneliness

[06:25.31 - 06:33.39] Speaker 2:  Allah Almighty one day blessed him with something something unique what was it? How are you?

[06:34.34 - 06:38.60] Speaker 2:  Eve may peace be upon her and there we had Adam and how are you?

[06:39.37 - 06:49.79] Speaker 2:  Narrations speak about what exactly happened at that moment there are so many narrations and actually Judaism, Islam and Christianity share some of these

[06:50.41 - 06:58.39] Speaker 2:  narrations in the sense that they agree to a certain extent with some of the things that happened and they disagree with some of the details

[06:58.39 - 07:10.37] Speaker 2:  Nonetheless what we have is sufficient for us. So he asks who are you she says I am how are you?

[07:10.37 - 07:18.89] Speaker 2:  You've been created she says I've been created to give you company and to give you peace and so on

[07:18.89 - 07:30.89] Speaker 2:  So Allah who Akbar amazing they were then living so happily so beautifully but Shaykh Khan kept coming to them and he kept trying something

[07:30.93 - 07:44.81] Speaker 2:  When he knew that Allah does not like something he kept on encouraging them to do it and who did Allah tell the instruction to? He told it to Adam Alayhi selam to say

[07:45.96 - 07:59.10] Speaker 2:  This is paradise this is genuine this is the garden you can do whatever you want here there is nothing prohibited nothing that you need to stay away from you can do whatever you wish

[07:59.10 - 08:7.14] Speaker 2:  There is only one tree that I don't want you to go close to don't eat from its fruit don't eat from its fruit

[08:8.64 - 08:21.57] Speaker 2:  Adam Alayhi selam new this Shaykh Khan kept telling him you know what you want to live long what was the discussion about death was not even spoken about at that point

[08:22.07 - 08:31.10] Speaker 2:  You want to live forever do you want to have more than what you actually have if you want to have more and he had everything

[08:32.22 - 08:41.54] Speaker 2:  Then you have to do something and he kept repeating it kept repeating it kept repeating when repetition happens people begin to believe what is

[08:41.54 - 08:47.72] Speaker 2:  Being said even though it's a lie like you notice the news right now about Razza and what's happening in Lebanon

[08:48.04 - 08:53.50] Speaker 2:  The most immoral army in the world keeps talking about how moral they are

[08:54.15 - 09:0.33] Speaker 2:  Moral moral they've been saying it from before the reason why they say it is because they've planned immorality

[09:0.33 - 09:10.39] Speaker 2:  They need to con the world into believing by repetition alone that we are moral and they will get a standing ovation where they go moral very moral

[09:10.39 - 09:14.53] Speaker 2:  And so on they keep telling they keep repeating the same thing

[09:14.53 - 09:20.19] Speaker 2:  This is our land this is our land it was ours it's biblical and so on it will keep happening

[09:20.19 - 09:26.65] Speaker 2:  They will keep saying that the reason is that repetition is what will brain wash the people of the globe

[09:26.65 - 09:33.81] Speaker 2:  Shaykh Khan's plan from the very beginning his plan is repeat keep on saying the same thing over and over again

[09:33.81 - 09:40.37] Speaker 2:  Why do you think Allah has instructed us to call for the prayer five times a day

[09:40.39 - 09:44.05] Speaker 2:  And to repeat those words when you're about to pray again

[09:44.05 - 09:48.91] Speaker 2:  Subhan Allah it could have just been said once you guys have to pray five times a day

[09:48.91 - 09:55.01] Speaker 2:  But they need to be a call again and again and again and again that repetition is beneficial for you

[09:55.01 - 10:1.57] Speaker 2:  It will help you it will help mold you and build you Allah's repetition is for the right direction

[10:1.57 - 10:4.79] Speaker 2:  Shaykh Khan's repetition is for the wrong direction

[10:4.79 - 10:10.25] Speaker 2:  They will make you think that something that is good is bad and something that is bad is good

[10:10.25 - 10:16.93] Speaker 2:  That shaytan's repetition so understand this because it is very serious when you think of it

[10:16.93 - 10:25.33] Speaker 2:  You and I want success and we are searching for success in everything besides what Allah told us is success

[10:25.33 - 10:27.77] Speaker 2:  Hyal al-Fala

[10:30.15 - 10:33.41] Speaker 1:  Come to success who is telling you that?

[10:33.41 - 10:39.85] Speaker 1:  Allah he your Lord is telling you that your maker is telling you come to success

[10:39.85 - 10:44.45] Speaker 1:  But you are searching for success in everything else are you going to get it elsewhere?

[10:45.13 - 10:48.09] Speaker 1:  No so all Allah wants you to do his pray

[10:48.09 - 10:54.71] Speaker 1:  It is not easy Shaykh Khan will distract you so much other so many other things will distract you

[10:54.71 - 10:57.25] Speaker 1:  But you have to be strong that's my success

[10:57.25 - 10:59.41] Speaker 1:  I need to pray how long does it take?

[10:59.47 - 11:4.39] Speaker 1:  It doesn't even take long to do something pleasing to Allah does not take long

[11:4.39 - 11:12.85] Speaker 1:  In fact when you do it the bonus of the deed is such that you will achieve much more than you bargained for

[11:13.62 - 11:21.02] Speaker 1:  When you wash yourself five times a day to pray you don't even know how you've benefited yourself

[11:21.02 - 11:23.26] Speaker 1:  Beyond what you had planned

[11:23.26 - 11:30.98] Speaker 1:  People I remember a brother who told me I had a back problem sciatic was hurting this way that way and I never used to pray

[11:30.98 - 11:36.56] Speaker 1:  He says when I started praying one of the scholars who taught me how to pray told me when you are sitting

[11:36.56 - 11:42.76] Speaker 1:  You need to bend your feet in a specific way and it might be a bit painful for you

[11:42.76 - 11:44.50] Speaker 1:  He says you won't believe it

[11:44.50 - 11:52.32] Speaker 1:  I started praying properly with the proper bending for Ruku and sujuud and sitting with my toes facing the kibla

[11:52.32 - 11:59.86] Speaker 1:  And it was quite painful and I didn't even notice that my sciatic nerve and whatever was hurting them on my back

[11:59.86 - 12:3.20] Speaker 1:  Everything was cured by the will of Allah so I don't know what to add

[12:3.20 - 12:5.30] Speaker 1:  He didn't bargain for that

[12:5.82 - 12:7.24] Speaker 1:  It was part of

[12:7.47 - 12:13.59] Speaker 1:  His own stretching when the doctor says do this and do this we're ready to do it when Allah says do this and do that

[12:13.59 - 12:20.07] Speaker 1:  One of the perks of it is definitely you're going to have benefits you don't even know

[12:20.07 - 12:31.77] Speaker 1:  Imagine doing salam to the right all the way such that your neck has moved only and you're actually supposed to keep your chest facing the kibla at all times

[12:31.77 - 12:37.79] Speaker 1:  Only your neck moves right to the side what happens what it stretches is something amazing

[12:38.17 - 12:42.25] Speaker 1:  But when the doctor tells you to stretch that you'll do it

[12:42.25 - 12:45.37] Speaker 1:  When Allah tells you come to success

[12:45.37 - 12:46.77] Speaker 1:  What do you do?

[12:47.13 - 12:47.49] Speaker 1:  Allah Hu Akbar

[12:47.49 - 12:48.65] Speaker 1:  Let's go back

[12:48.65 - 12:51.55] Speaker 1:  Adam Alayhi Salam Shaykh Pans repetition

[12:51.55 - 12:53.75] Speaker 1:  Made him falta

[12:53.75 - 12:55.67] Speaker 1:  And it made him falta

[12:55.67 - 13:0.65] Speaker 1:  One of the bonuses of it is it gives us comfort today

[13:0.65 - 13:4.97] Speaker 1:  To learn about it to be able to apply it in our lives

[13:4.97 - 13:6.61] Speaker 1:  Allah told him

[13:6.61 - 13:9.43] Speaker 1:  And when Allah told him about it, he said

[13:9.43 - 13:11.89] Speaker 1:  Don't get close to the street

[13:11.89 - 13:13.25] Speaker 1:  And what happens? Allah says

[13:13.25 - 13:14.35] Speaker 1:  For what's the matter?

[13:14.67 - 13:15.37] Speaker 1:  He said

[13:15.37 - 13:15.83] Speaker 1:  He said

[13:18.97 - 13:20.65] Speaker 2:  Adam Alayhi Salam Shaykh Pans

[13:20.65 - 13:26.91] Speaker 2:  Shaykh Pans started whispering

[13:27.91 - 13:31.57] Speaker 2:  Again and again these thoughts that come to you and I

[13:31.57 - 13:34.67] Speaker 2:  You know what you have to do? You have to ignore them

[13:35.05 - 13:38.21] Speaker 2:  You have to occupy yourself with something beneficial

[13:38.59 - 13:41.01] Speaker 2:  And you have to ignore Shaykh Pans

[13:41.01 - 13:43.97] Speaker 2:  And you have to say ahudabillah him in a Shaykh Pans

[13:43.97 - 13:48.15] Speaker 2:  And don't become depressed because you have

[13:48.15 - 13:52.49] Speaker 2:  Intrusive thoughts because we all get intrusive thoughts

[13:52.49 - 13:53.87] Speaker 2:  To different levels

[13:53.87 - 13:56.25] Speaker 2:  But how we deal with it differs

[13:56.25 - 13:58.43] Speaker 2:  When you are strong and you have knowledge

[13:58.43 - 14:1.15] Speaker 2:  You know these intrusive thoughts are normal

[14:1.15 - 14:2.55] Speaker 2:  They might come to my mind

[14:2.55 - 14:5.47] Speaker 2:  You know what? I am going to make sure I discount them

[14:5.47 - 14:7.83] Speaker 2:  I will defy them and work against them

[14:7.83 - 14:10.23] Speaker 2:  So Shaykh Pans has different types of plans

[14:10.23 - 14:13.05] Speaker 2:  We want to go back to that plan he used there

[14:13.05 - 14:14.41] Speaker 2:  He repeated something

[14:14.41 - 14:17.37] Speaker 2:  He made it beneficial by saying you are going to be wealthy

[14:17.37 - 14:18.77] Speaker 2:  And you are not going to die

[14:18.77 - 14:20.03] Speaker 2:  Up to today

[14:20.03 - 14:22.03] Speaker 2:  If someone tells you you are going to make a million

[14:22.03 - 14:24.63] Speaker 2:  Let's do this sometimes you might think

[14:24.89 - 14:26.57] Speaker 2:  And you might say no no no no

[14:27.67 - 14:28.97] Speaker 2:  If it is

[14:28.97 - 14:30.93] Speaker 2:  And they tell you you are going to make 10 million

[14:30.93 - 14:32.51] Speaker 2:  You are going to make 50 million

[14:32.51 - 14:33.83] Speaker 2:  What will you?

[14:33.85 - 14:35.23] Speaker 2:  You might start scratching your head

[14:35.23 - 14:36.67] Speaker 2:  And saying never mind I will give a charity

[14:36.67 - 14:37.55] Speaker 2:  Or 5 million

[14:37.55 - 14:39.43] Speaker 2:  And I will cut a Shaykh Pans can

[14:40.21 - 14:41.39] Speaker 2:  Now what else?

[14:41.55 - 14:43.63] Speaker 2:  When he tells you you are going to be young forever

[14:43.63 - 14:45.55] Speaker 2:  You are going to be young no bone pains

[14:45.55 - 14:47.35] Speaker 2:  No nothing nothing is going to happen

[14:47.35 - 14:49.69] Speaker 2:  You are going to be young and you are going to not die

[14:49.69 - 14:50.91] Speaker 2:  Imagine you won't die

[14:50.91 - 14:52.25] Speaker 2:  You won't die

[14:52.87 - 14:54.09] Speaker 2:  That is a fraud

[14:54.09 - 14:55.83] Speaker 2:  We are all going to die

[14:55.83 - 14:59.11] Speaker 2:  And there is no even time as to when you are going to die

[14:59.11 - 15:0.07] Speaker 2:  Or I am going to die

[15:0.07 - 15:3.31] Speaker 2:  But I can tell you that type of trap is the devil's waswasa

[15:3.85 - 15:6.17] Speaker 2:  So he says just eat from the tree

[15:6.17 - 15:7.41] Speaker 2:  Nothing else

[15:8.41 - 15:11.15] Speaker 2:  Without giving a deeper thought one day Adam

[15:11.15 - 15:12.53] Speaker 2:  Alayhi salam fell

[15:13.49 - 15:15.07] Speaker 2:  With his wife

[15:15.92 - 15:19.38] Speaker 2:  Let's never get into the debate about who ate first

[15:19.64 - 15:22.12] Speaker 2:  Because if I were to ask you who ate first

[15:22.12 - 15:22.84] Speaker 2:  What would you say?

[15:23.04 - 15:24.78] Speaker 2:  Was it Adam or Eve or how?

[15:25.43 - 15:26.75] Speaker 2:  Who ate first?

[15:27.23 - 15:27.83] Speaker 2:  Anyone knows?

[15:28.49 - 15:29.63] Speaker 2:  Who was it?

[15:30.29 - 15:31.27] Speaker 2:  Who was it?

[15:31.27 - 15:32.35] Speaker 2:  We don't know

[15:32.35 - 15:33.45] Speaker 2:  We don't need to know

[15:33.45 - 15:35.37] Speaker 2:  All we know is they ate together

[15:35.37 - 15:36.15] Speaker 2:  Because why?

[15:36.39 - 15:37.75] Speaker 2:  Allah says for Akala

[15:38.27 - 15:38.83] Speaker 2:  Minha

[15:38.83 - 15:40.45] Speaker 2:  For that woman

[15:41.25 - 15:41.89] Speaker 2:  To whom?

[15:42.47 - 15:44.21] Speaker 2:  Allah says both of them ate

[15:44.21 - 15:45.05] Speaker 2:  So what happens?

[15:45.85 - 15:47.77] Speaker 2:  They were ashamed after that

[15:47.77 - 15:48.03] Speaker 2:  ashamed

[15:48.03 - 15:48.69] Speaker 2:  Immediately

[15:49.27 - 15:50.85] Speaker 2:  I want to stop for a minute

[15:50.85 - 15:53.11] Speaker 2:  You and I have been given instructions

[15:53.11 - 15:54.85] Speaker 2:  By the same Allah

[15:55.30 - 15:56.60] Speaker 2:  The same Allah

[15:56.60 - 15:57.16] Speaker 2:  Yet

[15:57.72 - 15:58.86] Speaker 2:  Sometimes we fall

[15:58.86 - 15:59.80] Speaker 2:  When you fall

[15:59.80 - 16:2.76] Speaker 2:  It does not make you an evil person

[16:2.76 - 16:3.82] Speaker 2:  You are a human

[16:3.82 - 16:4.74] Speaker 2:  You will fall

[16:4.74 - 16:5.64] Speaker 2:  You shall fall

[16:5.64 - 16:6.90] Speaker 2:  You have fallen

[16:6.90 - 16:9.16] Speaker 2:  And there is nobody who won't fall

[16:9.16 - 16:11.24] Speaker 2:  The first from amongst us has fallen

[16:11.24 - 16:12.08] Speaker 2:  Only NabisAllah

[16:12.44 - 16:13.50] Speaker 2:  Alayhi wa Selam

[16:13.50 - 16:16.10] Speaker 2:  And those who are protected by Allah

[16:16.10 - 16:17.16] Speaker 2:  Subhanahu wa Teala

[16:17.16 - 16:18.26] Speaker 2:  Prophethood

[16:18.26 - 16:19.40] Speaker 2:  Allah chose them

[16:19.40 - 16:20.08] Speaker 2:  They were saved

[16:20.52 - 16:21.62] Speaker 2:  You and I

[16:21.62 - 16:23.08] Speaker 2:  Normal human beings

[16:23.34 - 16:24.60] Speaker 2:  What do you expect?

[16:24.78 - 16:25.62] Speaker 2:  You are going to fall

[16:25.62 - 16:26.66] Speaker 2:  You have fallen

[16:26.66 - 16:27.80] Speaker 2:  You shall fall

[16:29.17 - 16:30.87] Speaker 2:  That doesn't make you evil

[16:30.87 - 16:33.49] Speaker 2:  What makes you a person with negativity

[16:33.49 - 16:36.05] Speaker 2:  Is when you remain there

[16:36.28 - 16:38.50] Speaker 2:  Adam Alayhi Selam fell

[16:38.79 - 16:40.67] Speaker 2:  As soon as he fell

[16:40.67 - 16:42.53] Speaker 2:  He was ashamed of the deed

[16:42.53 - 16:44.39] Speaker 2:  Do you feel ashamed of the deed

[16:44.39 - 16:45.65] Speaker 2:  As soon as you do it

[16:45.65 - 16:47.85] Speaker 2:  If yes is your answer

[16:47.85 - 16:49.27] Speaker 2:  You are still a believer

[16:49.27 - 16:51.53] Speaker 2:  You have a good connection with Allah

[16:52.07 - 16:54.03] Speaker 2:  At least you fear Allah

[16:54.03 - 16:55.47] Speaker 2:  When you commit to the sin

[16:55.47 - 16:57.17] Speaker 2:  And you say I shouldn't have done this

[16:57.17 - 16:58.17] Speaker 2:  Astaghfirullah

[16:58.20 - 17:0.18] Speaker 2:  That means you are a believer

[17:0.82 - 17:2.68] Speaker 2:  Either Sarratkah Hassanah

[17:2.68 - 17:3.42] Speaker 2:  Tokawasah

[17:3.42 - 17:3.88] Speaker 2:  Atkawasah

[17:3.88 - 17:3.92] Speaker 2:  Atkawasah

[17:3.92 - 17:3.96] Speaker 2:  Atkawasah

[17:3.96 - 17:4.12] Speaker 2:  Atkawasah

[17:4.12 - 17:8.70] Speaker 2:  You want to know

[17:8.70 - 17:9.68] Speaker 2:  Who is the believer

[17:9.68 - 17:10.52] Speaker 2:  He says

[17:10.52 - 17:13.14] Speaker 2:  When your good deed makes you happy

[17:13.14 - 17:15.40] Speaker 2:  And your bad deed makes you regret

[17:15.40 - 17:17.22] Speaker 2:  That's a sign that you're a believer

[17:17.22 - 17:18.60] Speaker 2:  Because there are others

[17:18.60 - 17:20.44] Speaker 2:  Who don't regret anything

[17:20.44 - 17:21.94] Speaker 2:  They do as they wish

[17:21.94 - 17:22.90] Speaker 2:  So don't worry

[17:22.90 - 17:23.94] Speaker 2:  Relax your human

[17:23.94 - 17:25.02] Speaker 2:  You fall

[17:25.02 - 17:26.98] Speaker 2:  Don't stay there

[17:26.98 - 17:28.70] Speaker 2:  Say Allah forgive me

[17:29.46 - 17:31.46] Speaker 2:  When Adam Alayhi Salam

[17:31.46 - 17:32.98] Speaker 2:  Committed the sin

[17:32.98 - 17:35.04] Speaker 2:  If you think of it carefully

[17:35.04 - 17:36.86] Speaker 2:  You will have so much hope

[17:36.86 - 17:38.10] Speaker 2:  In your heart

[17:38.10 - 17:40.70] Speaker 2:  That I will be forgiven by Allah

[17:40.70 - 17:44.78] Speaker 2:  Because Allah told him not to do one thing

[17:44.78 - 17:45.84] Speaker 2:  Only

[17:45.84 - 17:46.80] Speaker 2:  And what did he do?

[17:47.81 - 17:49.13] Speaker 2:  Only that thing

[17:49.13 - 17:51.51] Speaker 2:  Allah told him not to do one thing

[17:51.51 - 17:51.87] Speaker 2:  Only

[17:51.87 - 17:53.01] Speaker 2:  And that's the thing

[17:53.01 - 17:54.33] Speaker 2:  He did immediately

[17:54.33 - 17:55.83] Speaker 2:  He says Allah forgive me

[17:55.83 - 17:57.97] Speaker 2:  You know how beautifully he worded it

[17:57.97 - 18:0.01] Speaker 2:  Up to today we use those words

[18:0.77 - 18:2.65] Speaker 2:  The two of them says

[18:2.65 - 18:3.59] Speaker 2:  Say

[18:3.88 - 18:5.88] Speaker 2:  ربنا ولمنا

[18:6.66 - 18:9.46] Speaker 2:  فسنة وإن لم ترغفر لنا

[18:9.46 - 18:11.96] Speaker 2:  وطرغ حمنا لنا كوننا

[18:11.96 - 18:14.02] Speaker 2:  نمنا من الحصيرين

[18:14.56 - 18:15.72] Speaker 2:  Or our Lord

[18:15.72 - 18:17.32] Speaker 2:  We have wronged ourselves

[18:17.32 - 18:19.82] Speaker 2:  And if you don't forgive us

[18:19.82 - 18:21.76] Speaker 2:  And if you don't have mercy on us

[18:21.76 - 18:23.06] Speaker 2:  We will be the losers

[18:23.06 - 18:24.92] Speaker 2:  Allah is not going to lose

[18:24.92 - 18:27.52] Speaker 2:  Allah says we forgave them

[18:30.07 - 18:32.85] Speaker 1:  And then we sent them on earth

[18:32.85 - 18:35.03] Speaker 1:  Why did Allah send them to earth

[18:35.03 - 18:36.51] Speaker 1:  You know people say

[18:36.51 - 18:38.51] Speaker 1:  Well if Adam Alayhi Salam didn't send

[18:38.51 - 18:39.75] Speaker 1:  We don't be in paradise

[18:40.77 - 18:41.37] Speaker 1:  Relax

[18:41.94 - 18:44.14] Speaker 1:  Allah wanted it

[18:44.14 - 18:46.04] Speaker 1:  Allah planned it in a way

[18:46.04 - 18:47.86] Speaker 1:  That he wanted to teach us

[18:47.86 - 18:49.76] Speaker 1:  What to do when we falter

[18:49.76 - 18:52.70] Speaker 1:  That's why he planned the way things happened

[18:52.70 - 18:53.70] Speaker 1:  To happen

[18:53.70 - 18:56.40] Speaker 1:  And then they were supposed to come on earth

[18:56.40 - 18:57.42] Speaker 1:  Where you and I

[18:57.42 - 18:59.02] Speaker 1:  We're going to be born

[18:59.02 - 19:1.96] Speaker 1:  And Allah's teaching to us

[19:1.96 - 19:3.58] Speaker 1:  Is whenever this happens

[19:3.58 - 19:5.24] Speaker 1:  You need to do that

[19:5.37 - 19:7.01] Speaker 1:  This will happen

[19:7.01 - 19:8.73] Speaker 1:  So that must happen

[19:8.73 - 19:9.71] Speaker 1:  If you're a believer

[19:9.71 - 19:11.75] Speaker 1:  That's a sign that you're close to Allah

[19:11.75 - 19:13.57] Speaker 1:  To regret your sin

[19:14.34 - 19:15.52] Speaker 1:  Since a planty

[19:16.10 - 19:18.28] Speaker 1:  A sign of your distance from Allah

[19:18.28 - 19:19.42] Speaker 1:  Is when you don't regret it

[19:19.42 - 19:20.32] Speaker 1:  All you committed again

[19:20.32 - 19:21.26] Speaker 1:  And again you happy

[19:21.26 - 19:24.42] Speaker 1:  And excited and there is no stopping to it

[19:24.42 - 19:27.20] Speaker 1:  There is no way that you think this thing needs to stop

[19:27.20 - 19:29.50] Speaker 1:  Even the thought is a blessing from Allah

[19:29.50 - 19:31.00] Speaker 1:  To say this thing needs to stop

[19:31.00 - 19:32.12] Speaker 1:  When you know that

[19:32.12 - 19:33.06] Speaker 1:  It needs to stop

[19:33.06 - 19:34.52] Speaker 1:  You and I know what's wrong

[19:34.52 - 19:36.14] Speaker 1:  You and I know what we are doing

[19:36.14 - 19:36.92] Speaker 1:  That is wrong

[19:36.92 - 19:38.14] Speaker 1:  Including myself

[19:38.14 - 19:40.38] Speaker 1:  You and I know what needs to be done

[19:40.38 - 19:41.56] Speaker 1:  To please Allah

[19:41.56 - 19:43.16] Speaker 1:  But we're human

[19:43.16 - 19:44.94] Speaker 1:  At least have the thought in your mind

[19:44.94 - 19:45.68] Speaker 1:  Allah one day

[19:45.68 - 19:47.12] Speaker 1:  I want to stop this nonsense

[19:47.12 - 19:48.56] Speaker 1:  And all one day

[19:48.56 - 19:50.37] Speaker 1:  I want to do what I'm supposed to be doing

[19:50.76 - 19:53.50] Speaker 1:  You know you're supposed to be praying five times a day

[19:53.50 - 19:54.88] Speaker 1:  Yesterday we were in Edinburgh

[19:54.88 - 19:57.34] Speaker 1:  A lot of youngsters were sitting in front of me

[19:57.34 - 19:59.86] Speaker 1:  And I said how many times do we pray

[20:0.85 - 20:2.93] Speaker 1:  Someone said look to be honest

[20:2.93 - 20:3.99] Speaker 1:  You know two times

[20:3.99 - 20:4.93] Speaker 1:  Someone said three times

[20:4.93 - 20:6.25] Speaker 1:  It's a fact

[20:6.25 - 20:10.09] Speaker 1:  We know we're supposed to be praying five times a day

[20:10.09 - 20:11.08] Speaker 1:  If you are weak

[20:11.55 - 20:13.37] Speaker 1:  At minute that I am weak

[20:13.37 - 20:15.67] Speaker 1:  But aim at the five

[20:15.67 - 20:17.15] Speaker 1:  So Allah aim there

[20:17.15 - 20:18.35] Speaker 1:  Allah strengthen me

[20:18.35 - 20:19.07] Speaker 1:  Make do ah

[20:19.07 - 20:20.47] Speaker 1:  Allah grant me the strength

[20:20.47 - 20:21.39] Speaker 1:  To do the right thing

[20:21.39 - 20:22.65] Speaker 1:  All I am weak

[20:22.65 - 20:23.77] Speaker 1:  Of course I miss the future

[20:23.77 - 20:24.45] Speaker 1:  Again

[20:24.45 - 20:25.65] Speaker 1:  Or I miss the answer

[20:25.65 - 20:26.21] Speaker 1:  Again

[20:26.21 - 20:27.77] Speaker 1:  It must make you sad

[20:27.77 - 20:30.03] Speaker 1:  That's a sign of the mercy of Allah

[20:30.03 - 20:31.41] Speaker 1:  Because without that sadness

[20:31.41 - 20:33.73] Speaker 1:  You are not going to go into the right direction

[20:33.73 - 20:34.65] Speaker 1:  At all

[20:35.53 - 20:37.55] Speaker 1:  So please when you are doing something

[20:37.55 - 20:38.79] Speaker 1:  Displeasing to Allah

[20:38.79 - 20:40.81] Speaker 1:  Admitted that this is displeasing

[20:40.81 - 20:41.63] Speaker 1:  Within yourself

[20:41.63 - 20:43.07] Speaker 1:  Admitted at least

[20:43.07 - 20:44.57] Speaker 1:  Don't justify it

[20:44.57 - 20:46.81] Speaker 1:  Today we are living in an age of justification

[20:47.31 - 20:48.93] Speaker 1:  People will come and say

[20:49.28 - 20:50.76] Speaker 1:  I don't need to do this

[20:50.76 - 20:52.80] Speaker 1:  Because I don't find the verse of the Quran saying

[20:52.80 - 20:54.32] Speaker 1:  You have to pray five times a day

[20:54.32 - 20:55.12] Speaker 1:  It just says pray

[20:55.12 - 20:55.82] Speaker 1:  So I pray

[20:55.82 - 20:56.50] Speaker 1:  Oh

[20:57.04 - 20:58.64] Speaker 1:  Now there is no hope for you

[20:58.64 - 21:1.12] Speaker 1:  Because unless you turn

[21:1.12 - 21:1.90] Speaker 1:  Holistically

[21:1.90 - 21:3.36] Speaker 1:  Allah wants you to turn one day

[21:3.36 - 21:4.88] Speaker 1:  But because you are justifying

[21:4.88 - 21:7.08] Speaker 1:  That you don't have to pray

[21:7.08 - 21:8.32] Speaker 1:  And where did you get that from?

[21:8.56 - 21:8.72] Speaker 1:  You're saying

[21:8.72 - 21:9.80] Speaker 1:  Well not five times a day

[21:9.80 - 21:11.24] Speaker 1:  Because we are in the Quran

[21:11.24 - 21:12.40] Speaker 1:  My brother

[21:12.40 - 21:13.94] Speaker 1:  There is a whole sunnah

[21:13.94 - 21:14.94] Speaker 1:  Of the Prophet ﷺ

[21:14.94 - 21:16.94] Speaker 1:  If you don't believe in it

[21:16.94 - 21:18.44] Speaker 1:  You have not believed in the Quran

[21:18.94 - 21:21.04] Speaker 1:  Because the Quran tells you

[21:21.04 - 21:22.18] Speaker 1:  To adopt the sunnah

[21:22.18 - 21:23.44] Speaker 1:  There we go

[21:23.44 - 21:25.96] Speaker 1:  The Quran tells you to get the explanation

[21:25.96 - 21:27.26] Speaker 1:  From the Prophet Muhammad

[21:27.26 - 21:28.36] Speaker 1:  Peace be upon him

[21:28.36 - 21:29.96] Speaker 1:  For nearly everything

[21:29.96 - 21:31.98] Speaker 1:  So don't just drop out

[21:31.98 - 21:33.20] Speaker 1:  Come in

[21:33.20 - 21:33.80] Speaker 1:  Admitted

[21:33.80 - 21:34.76] Speaker 1:  Say, look over Allah

[21:34.76 - 21:35.54] Speaker 1:  I am weak

[21:35.54 - 21:36.44] Speaker 1:  Strengthen me

[21:36.44 - 21:38.14] Speaker 1:  And when you make a dua to Allah

[21:38.14 - 21:39.06] Speaker 1:  To strengthen you

[21:39.06 - 21:39.86] Speaker 1:  Well God

[21:39.86 - 21:41.48] Speaker 1:  I give you an example

[21:41.48 - 21:42.62] Speaker 1:  You can't say

[21:42.62 - 21:44.66] Speaker 1:  Oh Allah strengthen me to get up for a future

[21:44.66 - 21:46.76] Speaker 1:  And then you haven't set an alarm

[21:47.24 - 21:48.38] Speaker 1:  Or your alarm rings

[21:48.38 - 21:49.30] Speaker 1:  You snooze it and say

[21:49.30 - 21:50.32] Speaker 1:  Well Allah will wake me up

[21:50.32 - 21:50.98] Speaker 1:  I made dua

[21:50.98 - 21:52.54] Speaker 1:  And then you see the sun rising

[21:52.54 - 21:53.18] Speaker 1:  And say, Inshallah

[21:53.18 - 21:54.46] Speaker 1:  I'll be up just now

[21:54.46 - 21:55.54] Speaker 1:  And then the sun rises

[21:55.54 - 21:56.40] Speaker 1:  And you gotta go to work

[21:56.40 - 21:58.38] Speaker 1:  You say, well Allah didn't get me up for a future

[21:58.38 - 21:59.60] Speaker 1:  But I'm up for work

[21:59.60 - 22:0.48] Speaker 1:  That's nonsense

[22:0.48 - 22:2.08] Speaker 1:  No way

[22:2.08 - 22:4.10] Speaker 1:  If you're making dua to Allah

[22:4.10 - 22:6.16] Speaker 1:  Allah strengthen me to fulfil my future

[22:7.01 - 22:8.21] Speaker 1:  You must definitely

[22:9.11 - 22:11.09] Speaker 1:  Make an effort and push yourself

[22:11.09 - 22:11.97] Speaker 1:  Of that bed

[22:11.97 - 22:12.97] Speaker 1:  Well Allah he

[22:12.97 - 22:14.61] Speaker 1:  When you get regular with the future

[22:14.61 - 22:16.63] Speaker 1:  And four months pass

[22:17.33 - 22:17.85] Speaker 1:  Inshallah

[22:17.85 - 22:19.43] Speaker 1:  If you have not missed

[22:19.43 - 22:21.47] Speaker 1:  Or you've hardly ever missed

[22:21.47 - 22:23.13] Speaker 1:  At that particular time

[22:23.13 - 22:24.43] Speaker 1:  Or during that time

[22:24.43 - 22:26.21] Speaker 1:  You get to a point where

[22:26.21 - 22:26.93] Speaker 1:  Time of Fajr

[22:26.93 - 22:29.21] Speaker 1:  Your eye opens before your alarm

[22:29.21 - 22:30.39] Speaker 1:  Well Allah here I promise

[22:30.39 - 22:33.37] Speaker 1:  I'm sure many of us have that experience

[22:33.37 - 22:34.47] Speaker 1:  Your eye just opens

[22:34.47 - 22:36.55] Speaker 1:  And there's five minutes remaining for the alarm

[22:36.55 - 22:37.79] Speaker 1:  And Subhanallah

[22:37.79 - 22:38.17] Speaker 1:  Why?

[22:38.49 - 22:40.03] Speaker 1:  Because you've got yourself used

[22:40.03 - 22:42.41] Speaker 1:  To something Allah created you in a way

[22:42.41 - 22:44.43] Speaker 1:  That your body will acknowledge it

[22:45.89 - 22:46.53] Speaker 1:  Subhanallah

[22:46.53 - 22:48.77] Speaker 1:  So Adam Alayhi Salam Fale

[22:48.77 - 22:49.53] Speaker 1:  He sought forgiveness

[22:49.53 - 22:50.45] Speaker 1:  He was forgiven

[22:50.45 - 22:52.17] Speaker 1:  He went onto the earth

[22:52.17 - 22:53.21] Speaker 1:  He made this dua

[22:53.57 - 22:54.47] Speaker 1:  Allah forgave him

[22:54.47 - 22:55.15] Speaker 1:  And Allah said

[22:55.15 - 22:57.53] Speaker 1:  This is your

[22:57.53 - 23:0.03] Speaker 1:  In fact the angels had already told him

[23:0.03 - 23:0.93] Speaker 1:  This is the way

[23:0.93 - 23:2.17] Speaker 1:  Things should be done

[23:2.17 - 23:3.37] Speaker 1:  When you falter

[23:3.37 - 23:4.43] Speaker 1:  You admit it

[23:4.43 - 23:5.49] Speaker 1:  And you turn to Allah

[23:5.49 - 23:6.57] Speaker 1:  And you seek forgiveness

[23:6.57 - 23:9.51] Speaker 1:  And don't do that which is bad

[23:9.54 - 23:11.24] Speaker 1:  Now don't do that which is bad

[23:11.24 - 23:11.94] Speaker 1:  Is an instruction

[23:11.94 - 23:14.28] Speaker 1:  Man has done a lot of bad

[23:14.28 - 23:15.68] Speaker 1:  And keeps on doing bad

[23:15.68 - 23:17.54] Speaker 1:  And all of us have errors

[23:17.54 - 23:18.38] Speaker 1:  And mistakes

[23:18.38 - 23:19.70] Speaker 1:  The prophet Muhammad peace

[23:19.70 - 23:20.30] Speaker 1:  We upon him says

[23:20.30 - 23:22.88] Speaker 1:  The prophet Muhammad peace

[23:22.88 - 23:23.70] Speaker 1:  You know the meaning of

[23:24.54 - 23:25.96] Speaker 1:  Someone who makes

[23:27.05 - 23:29.07] Speaker 1:  Not just mistakes often

[23:29.20 - 23:31.42] Speaker 1:  But someone who does

[23:31.42 - 23:34.16] Speaker 1:  The wrong thing many times

[23:34.99 - 23:36.51] Speaker 1:  The Hadith says

[23:36.51 - 23:37.83] Speaker 1:  All human beings

[23:38.79 - 23:42.45] Speaker 1:  And the best of those who make mistakes

[23:42.45 - 23:43.37] Speaker 1:  So many times

[23:43.37 - 23:45.47] Speaker 1:  Or have committed so many sins

[23:45.47 - 23:49.17] Speaker 1:  Are those who engage in repentance

[23:49.17 - 23:50.63] Speaker 1:  So many times

[23:50.63 - 23:52.11] Speaker 1:  You committed sinah

[23:52.11 - 23:52.83] Speaker 1:  100 times

[23:52.83 - 23:53.55] Speaker 1:  You sought forgiveness

[23:53.55 - 23:54.69] Speaker 1:  A thousand times

[23:54.69 - 23:55.45] Speaker 1:  What happened

[23:56.06 - 24:0.06] Speaker 1:  I am not encouraging you to do something wrong

[24:0.06 - 24:1.14] Speaker 1:  But I am telling you

[24:1.14 - 24:3.22] Speaker 1:  We are living at a time

[24:3.95 - 24:6.65] Speaker 1:  And generally in a space

[24:6.65 - 24:7.83] Speaker 1:  Where

[24:8.67 - 24:11.65] Speaker 1:  A lot of negativity is happening

[24:11.65 - 24:14.71] Speaker 1:  So much pressure on our boys

[24:14.71 - 24:16.81] Speaker 1:  Our girls, our men, our women

[24:16.81 - 24:17.93] Speaker 1:  To do the wrong thing

[24:17.93 - 24:19.97] Speaker 1:  So easy to transgress

[24:20.37 - 24:22.67] Speaker 1:  But to do the right thing is a little bit difficult

[24:22.67 - 24:24.15] Speaker 1:  It's becoming more and more difficult

[24:24.15 - 24:25.25] Speaker 1:  That's from the Hadith

[24:25.25 - 24:27.15] Speaker 1:  The prophet Muhammad peace be upon him

[24:27.15 - 24:27.97] Speaker 1:  Spoke about it

[24:27.97 - 24:29.09] Speaker 1:  Because it's from Allah

[24:29.09 - 24:29.95] Speaker 1:  Allah new

[24:29.95 - 24:31.25] Speaker 1:  What's going to happen here

[24:31.25 - 24:32.77] Speaker 1:  In the 21st century

[24:32.77 - 24:34.67] Speaker 1:  And what will happen even later

[24:34.67 - 24:36.93] Speaker 1:  Allah new that you're going to walk out on the street

[24:36.93 - 24:38.99] Speaker 1:  And you're going to watch so many things

[24:38.99 - 24:40.49] Speaker 1:  You're going to be the most polite

[24:40.49 - 24:42.43] Speaker 1:  The most genuine, the most sincere

[24:43.07 - 24:43.55] Speaker 1:  Believer

[24:43.55 - 24:45.91] Speaker 1:  Because you have to respect everyone

[24:45.91 - 24:48.13] Speaker 1:  And you have to at the same time

[24:48.13 - 24:49.61] Speaker 1:  Navigate your faith

[24:49.61 - 24:51.47] Speaker 1:  In the midst of the environment

[24:51.47 - 24:53.67] Speaker 1:  That you're living in so Subhan Allah

[24:53.67 - 24:54.45] Speaker 1:  Alhamdulillah

[24:54.45 - 24:55.37] Speaker 1:  Allah Allah

[24:55.74 - 24:56.53] Speaker 1:  While you're walking

[24:56.53 - 24:57.65] Speaker 1:  Try to be conscious

[24:57.65 - 24:59.55] Speaker 1:  And wherever you've done something wrong

[24:59.55 - 25:0.69] Speaker 1:  Remembrance

[25:0.69 - 25:1.79] Speaker 1:  Allah is merciful

[25:1.79 - 25:2.55] Speaker 1:  He knows

[25:2.55 - 25:3.65] Speaker 1:  The Hadith says

[25:3.65 - 25:4.65] Speaker 1:  They will come a time

[25:4.65 - 25:6.19] Speaker 1:  Al-Kabildo Al-Al-Dini

[25:6.19 - 25:8.57] Speaker 1:  Kal-Kabildo Al-Jama

[25:9.08 - 25:10.72] Speaker 1:  They will come a time

[25:10.72 - 25:13.38] Speaker 1:  When a person trying to hold fast on his faith

[25:13.38 - 25:17.38] Speaker 1:  Will be similar to one who's holding a red hot cold

[25:17.38 - 25:19.10] Speaker 1:  What's a red hot cold

[25:19.10 - 25:19.94] Speaker 1:  Red hot cold

[25:19.94 - 25:21.34] Speaker 1:  You pick it up and you drop it

[25:21.34 - 25:22.16] Speaker 1:  You pick it up and it burns

[25:22.16 - 25:23.40] Speaker 1:  You drop it the other side

[25:23.40 - 25:24.24] Speaker 1:  You pick it up again

[25:24.24 - 25:25.54] Speaker 1:  And you go to keep picking it up

[25:25.54 - 25:26.62] Speaker 1:  That's what you've got to do

[25:26.62 - 25:27.98] Speaker 1:  May Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala

[25:27.98 - 25:30.34] Speaker 1:  Grant us ease

[25:30.37 - 25:32.51] Speaker 1:  So we're living in an age where

[25:32.51 - 25:33.73] Speaker 1:  It's not so easy

[25:33.73 - 25:35.05] Speaker 1:  Don't lie to yourself

[25:35.05 - 25:36.35] Speaker 1:  And don't fool yourself

[25:36.35 - 25:38.01] Speaker 1:  It's difficult out there

[25:38.01 - 25:41.55] Speaker 1:  Your children will probably find it more difficult than you

[25:41.55 - 25:44.41] Speaker 1:  And their children will find it even more difficult

[25:44.41 - 25:47.71] Speaker 1:  And that's the reason why today we are here at Balmainia

[25:48.13 - 25:48.53] Speaker 1:  Mashallah

[25:48.53 - 25:49.39] Speaker 1:  What a beautiful place

[25:49.39 - 25:50.29] Speaker 1:  Why did we gather?

[25:50.85 - 25:51.55] Speaker 1:  We gather Mashallah

[25:52.11 - 25:54.15] Speaker 1:  We give everyone the opportunity

[25:54.15 - 25:56.71] Speaker 1:  To reach out to the struggling brothers

[25:56.71 - 25:58.33] Speaker 1:  And sisters across the globe

[25:58.33 - 25:58.87] Speaker 1:  Mashallah

[25:58.87 - 25:59.59] Speaker 1:  That's a good thing

[25:59.59 - 26:1.05] Speaker 1:  But more than that

[26:1.05 - 26:3.85] Speaker 1:  To be able to touch the hearts

[26:4.15 - 26:5.73] Speaker 1:  To connect with Allah

[26:5.73 - 26:8.09] Speaker 1:  Even if it is step by step

[26:8.09 - 26:8.93] Speaker 1:  Connect with Allah

[26:8.93 - 26:10.73] Speaker 1:  You will never regret

[26:10.73 - 26:13.61] Speaker 1:  Nobody has ever regretted

[26:13.61 - 26:15.05] Speaker 1:  Their connection with Allah

[26:15.05 - 26:15.93] Speaker 1:  Nobody

[26:15.93 - 26:17.17] Speaker 1:  I am witnessing

[26:17.85 - 26:19.31] Speaker 1:  On social media

[26:19.31 - 26:20.21] Speaker 1:  And by the way

[26:20.21 - 26:22.93] Speaker 1:  I am trusting that we will use social media

[26:22.93 - 26:24.01] Speaker 1:  To do the right thing

[26:24.01 - 26:26.23] Speaker 1:  Because there is so much benefit

[26:26.23 - 26:27.91] Speaker 1:  You can achieve

[26:28.29 - 26:29.77] Speaker 1:  From social media

[26:29.77 - 26:31.83] Speaker 1:  When it's used in the right way

[26:31.93 - 26:33.55] Speaker 1:  So much of it

[26:33.55 - 26:36.61] Speaker 1:  And you can also use it for the wrong things

[26:36.61 - 26:38.65] Speaker 1:  And slide and destroy your life

[26:38.65 - 26:39.83] Speaker 1:  So you have to be careful

[26:39.83 - 26:43.25] Speaker 1:  If you are going to use it, make sure you do a proper job

[26:43.25 - 26:46.11] Speaker 1:  When I watch some things on social media

[26:46.11 - 26:48.83] Speaker 1:  I am noticing even the known Muslims

[26:48.83 - 26:50.33] Speaker 1:  Coming in

[26:50.33 - 26:53.15] Speaker 1:  And enjoying Islamic teachings

[26:53.15 - 26:55.35] Speaker 1:  And we born Muslims at times

[26:55.35 - 26:56.51] Speaker 1:  So those who have been Muslim

[26:56.51 - 26:57.85] Speaker 1:  For a long time

[26:57.85 - 27:0.69] Speaker 1:  Sometimes we don't appreciate the Dean of Allah

[27:0.69 - 27:3.07] Speaker 1:  And how it has brought us

[27:3.07 - 27:5.27] Speaker 1:  To such a beautiful level

[27:5.27 - 27:7.11] Speaker 1:  If we followed it

[27:8.39 - 27:9.59] Speaker 1:  There is a sister

[27:10.85 - 27:12.77] Speaker 1:  Asking chat GPT questions

[27:12.77 - 27:14.15] Speaker 1:  You might have seen that

[27:14.15 - 27:15.21] Speaker 1:  About Islam

[27:15.21 - 27:17.57] Speaker 1:  About the Prophet Muhammad Peace be upon him

[27:17.57 - 27:18.63] Speaker 1:  About the truth

[27:18.63 - 27:19.29] Speaker 1:  And falsehood

[27:19.79 - 27:21.43] Speaker 1:  And she gets clear

[27:21.43 - 27:23.07] Speaker 1:  Cut answers

[27:23.07 - 27:24.77] Speaker 1:  For your information

[27:24.77 - 27:26.99] Speaker 1:  She entered the fold of Islam

[27:28.27 - 27:29.55] Speaker 1:  And Subhan Allah

[27:29.55 - 27:31.83] Speaker 1:  Everyone got to see and watch and witness

[27:31.83 - 27:33.05] Speaker 1:  Who is that?

[27:33.13 - 27:34.37] Speaker 1:  A person who is not a Muslim

[27:34.37 - 27:35.69] Speaker 1:  Not too long ago

[27:35.69 - 27:36.85] Speaker 1:  And you and I

[27:36.85 - 27:39.57] Speaker 1:  How many years are you most of those here

[27:39.57 - 27:41.19] Speaker 1:  In this venue or this venue

[27:41.19 - 27:42.09] Speaker 1:  Or born Muslim

[27:42.09 - 27:44.67] Speaker 1:  Do you appreciate your faith

[27:44.67 - 27:45.85] Speaker 1:  Minimum and knowledge

[27:45.85 - 27:46.43] Speaker 1:  I am weak

[27:46.43 - 27:47.99] Speaker 1:  And we are going to strengthen ourselves

[27:47.99 - 27:50.71] Speaker 1:  And we are going to have a favor of Allah

[27:50.71 - 27:52.45] Speaker 1:  We have a favor of Allah

[27:52.45 - 27:53.95] Speaker 1:  It reminds me of an example

[27:53.95 - 27:56.39] Speaker 1:  We were asking kids to say

[27:56.39 - 27:59.25] Speaker 1:  Give an example of how you think

[27:59.25 - 28:1.19] Speaker 1:  The Ummah is treating Islam

[28:2.57 - 28:4.57] Speaker 1:  Do you know what one child says?

[28:5.41 - 28:7.37] Speaker 1:  Almost ten, maybe twelve years old

[28:7.37 - 28:11.53] Speaker 1:  He says it's like a person who has a Rolls Royce

[28:11.53 - 28:12.75] Speaker 1:  Listen to a child's example

[28:13.23 - 28:15.59] Speaker 1:  A person who has a Rolls Royce

[28:16.33 - 28:20.15] Speaker 1:  But still wants to drive their Priyas

[28:22.42 - 28:25.18] Speaker 2:  I am thinking what did you just say?

[28:25.75 - 28:26.89] Speaker 2:  A person has a Rolls Royce

[28:26.89 - 28:28.69] Speaker 2:  And still wants to drive a Priyas

[28:29.86 - 28:31.12] Speaker 2:  I say but

[28:31.12 - 28:32.60] Speaker 2:  Maybe they want to be humble

[28:32.60 - 28:34.00] Speaker 2:  Maybe he says no

[28:34.00 - 28:35.26] Speaker 2:  The Priyas doesn't work

[28:36.02 - 28:37.56] Speaker 2:  The Priyas doesn't work

[28:37.56 - 28:39.96] Speaker 2:  What is the child trying to say?

[28:39.96 - 28:42.62] Speaker 2:  You have something so valuable

[28:42.62 - 28:44.56] Speaker 2:  But you still want to be stuck in the rut

[28:44.56 - 28:46.46] Speaker 2:  Basically that's the message of the child

[28:46.46 - 28:47.64] Speaker 2:  You have a Rolls Royce

[28:48.14 - 28:48.74] Speaker 2:  Rolls Royce

[28:48.74 - 28:49.68] Speaker 2:  Come on Rolls Royce

[28:49.68 - 28:49.74] Speaker 2:  Come on Rolls Royce

[28:52.06 - 28:54.36] Speaker 2:  Did you notice two expensive things

[28:54.36 - 28:56.74] Speaker 2:  Start with ROROL

[28:56.90 - 28:58.84] Speaker 2:  What else starts with ROROL

[28:58.84 - 28:59.50] Speaker 2:  That's valuable

[29:1.22 - 29:1.76] Speaker 2:  Rolls Royce

[29:1.76 - 29:3.18] Speaker 2:  The Brothers know it straight away

[29:3.18 - 29:3.94] Speaker 2:  Man Mashallah

[29:12.22 - 29:13.38] Speaker 2:  We want to roll into January

[29:14.16 - 29:16.08] Speaker 2:  May Allah Almighty bless all of us

[29:16.08 - 29:17.20] Speaker 2:  My brothers and sisters

[29:17.20 - 29:19.40] Speaker 2:  Enjoy being a Muslim

[29:19.40 - 29:21.42] Speaker 2:  I promise you

[29:21.61 - 29:24.07] Speaker 2:  Enjoy the fact that you're a Muslim

[29:24.13 - 29:27.55] Speaker 2:  And you need to be proud of the fact you're a Muslim

[29:27.55 - 29:29.49] Speaker 2:  What does Islam do to you?

[29:29.69 - 29:32.09] Speaker 2:  It helps you build your relation with Allah

[29:33.17 - 29:36.81] Speaker 2:  It disciplines you and builds the best character

[29:36.81 - 29:39.89] Speaker 2:  Nobody can come close to the character of a believer

[29:39.89 - 29:40.69] Speaker 2:  No one

[29:40.69 - 29:43.39] Speaker 2:  If Islam teaches something trust me

[29:43.39 - 29:44.51] Speaker 2:  It is beneficial

[29:44.51 - 29:47.07] Speaker 2:  And if there is anything truly beneficial

[29:47.07 - 29:47.75] Speaker 2:  Out there

[29:47.75 - 29:49.23] Speaker 2:  Islam has taught it

[29:49.23 - 29:51.29] Speaker 2:  There's nothing forgotten

[29:51.33 - 29:52.91] Speaker 2:  So that's why be a good Muslim

[29:52.91 - 29:54.27] Speaker 2:  Islam teaches you

[29:54.27 - 29:56.01] Speaker 2:  To develop your link with Allah

[29:56.01 - 29:58.98] Speaker 2:  And it teaches you to develop yourself

[29:59.43 - 30:1.09] Speaker 2:  Because you're going to have a relation

[30:1.09 - 30:2.97] Speaker 2:  With the rest of the creatures of Allah

[30:2.97 - 30:7.13] Speaker 2:  So how I talk, how I walk, my temperament control

[30:7.13 - 30:8.93] Speaker 2:  Make sure you nurture yourself

[30:8.93 - 30:9.53] Speaker 2:  Push yourself

[30:9.53 - 30:11.25] Speaker 2:  Many of us have a temper

[30:11.25 - 30:13.11] Speaker 2:  Your temper will not go away

[30:13.11 - 30:14.67] Speaker 2:  You have to work on it

[30:14.67 - 30:16.57] Speaker 2:  You have to work hard on it

[30:16.57 - 30:17.57] Speaker 2:  You have bad habits

[30:17.57 - 30:20.89] Speaker 2:  You have to work very hard to eradicate those bad habits

[30:20.89 - 30:22.75] Speaker 2:  The people with good character

[30:22.75 - 30:25.27] Speaker 2:  Most of the time they didn't just

[30:25.27 - 30:28.07] Speaker 2:  Become with good character without an effort

[30:28.07 - 30:29.17] Speaker 2:  They made an effort

[30:29.17 - 30:30.77] Speaker 2:  I started watching my mouth

[30:30.77 - 30:31.71] Speaker 2:  I stopped swearing

[30:31.71 - 30:33.49] Speaker 2:  Today the F word

[30:33.49 - 30:34.87] Speaker 2:  The F word

[30:34.87 - 30:37.93] Speaker 2:  Is said like salt and pepper in food

[30:37.93 - 30:39.77] Speaker 2:  By people who are

[30:39.77 - 30:41.67] Speaker 2:  When you look at them they look like they do

[30:41.67 - 30:42.81] Speaker 2:  Sala five times a day

[30:42.81 - 30:44.41] Speaker 2:  And might even be getting up for 100

[30:45.51 - 30:46.67] Speaker 2:  And say you know

[30:55.21 - 30:55.85] Speaker 2:  That word

[30:55.85 - 30:58.43] Speaker 2:  The problem I have with it is the angels

[30:58.43 - 31:1.51] Speaker 2:  Register it on your book of deeds

[31:1.51 - 31:4.42] Speaker 2:  I don't need the word

[31:4.42 - 31:6.96] Speaker 2:  I'm a Muslim I'm going to utter beautiful

[31:7.48 - 31:8.34] Speaker 2:  Amazing words

[31:8.34 - 31:10.42] Speaker 2:  The angels are writing the words

[31:10.42 - 31:12.22] Speaker 2:  I must be happy to say they can write

[31:12.22 - 31:14.22] Speaker 2:  Some lovely words from to this day

[31:14.22 - 31:15.28] Speaker 2:  Onward

[31:15.35 - 31:17.37] Speaker 2:  The angels imagine your angels are writing

[31:17.37 - 31:18.17] Speaker 2:  Allahi

[31:18.17 - 31:20.25] Speaker 2:  May Allah be with you

[31:21.31 - 31:23.61] Speaker 2:  May Allah be with you

[31:23.61 - 31:26.11] Speaker 2:  May Allah be with you

[31:26.87 - 31:29.71] Speaker 2:  No body can ever utter a word

[31:29.71 - 31:33.59] Speaker 2:  Except that there is someone taking a record of it

[31:33.59 - 31:35.81] Speaker 2:  The angels are writing it down

[31:36.09 - 31:37.67] Speaker 2:  So it's not going to happen

[31:37.67 - 31:38.73] Speaker 2:  Without an effort

[31:38.73 - 31:39.47] Speaker 2:  Make an effort

[31:39.47 - 31:41.55] Speaker 2:  Tell yourself the angels are watching me

[31:41.55 - 31:42.99] Speaker 2:  They are writing down my words

[31:42.99 - 31:45.33] Speaker 2:  Why should I have F and F and F and so on

[31:45.33 - 31:47.11] Speaker 2:  And in some people it's a culture

[31:47.11 - 31:50.29] Speaker 2:  It's become no I'm a Muslim I can change that

[31:50.29 - 31:52.33] Speaker 2:  If your friends have it don't use those words

[31:52.33 - 31:53.23] Speaker 2:  Use good words

[31:53.23 - 31:54.61] Speaker 2:  The angels are writing your words

[31:54.61 - 31:55.93] Speaker 2:  Use amazing words

[31:55.93 - 31:58.35] Speaker 2:  Become a person who's so pleasant

[31:58.35 - 32:1.43] Speaker 2:  That when someone sees you they are happy to meet you

[32:1.43 - 32:4.21] Speaker 2:  And talk to you because the way you talk itself

[32:4.21 - 32:6.15] Speaker 2:  Is healing it's healing

[32:6.76 - 32:8.84] Speaker 2:  Some people you meet them

[32:9.56 - 32:11.34] Speaker 2:  You're a happy person you become depressed

[32:11.94 - 32:14.12] Speaker 2:  And some people you depressed you meet them

[32:14.12 - 32:14.98] Speaker 2:  And you become happy

[32:14.98 - 32:15.26] Speaker 2:  Why?

[32:15.70 - 32:17.56] Speaker 2:  It's because of the interaction

[32:17.56 - 32:21.16] Speaker 2:  The experience it's an experience to meet people

[32:22.22 - 32:24.50] Speaker 2:  Sometimes it's a beautiful experience

[32:24.50 - 32:27.14] Speaker 2:  You meet someone and they give you so much importance

[32:27.14 - 32:29.70] Speaker 2:  My brother how are you?

[32:36.20 - 32:37.16] Speaker 2:  I've earned a reward

[32:37.16 - 32:38.18] Speaker 2:  I've got good deeds

[32:38.18 - 32:39.84] Speaker 2:  That might be my ticket to paradise

[32:39.84 - 32:40.48] Speaker 2:  And guess what

[32:40.48 - 32:44.54] Speaker 2:  I was thankful to Allah for giving me the opportunity to do that

[32:44.54 - 32:46.82] Speaker 2:  I won't forget two days ago

[32:46.82 - 32:49.65] Speaker 2:  We were in three days ago

[32:49.65 - 32:51.31] Speaker 2:  We were in Newcastle

[32:52.69 - 32:54.77] Speaker 2:  A day before that we were in London

[32:54.77 - 32:55.67] Speaker 2:  One of the places

[32:55.67 - 32:58.07] Speaker 2:  Forget exactly where it was

[32:58.81 - 33:0.77] Speaker 2:  I said it in one of my talks

[33:0.77 - 33:3.55] Speaker 2:  Previously yesterday I said it in yesterday's speech

[33:3.55 - 33:6.23] Speaker 2:  An uncle comes to me as I'm walking out of the mosque

[33:6.23 - 33:7.17] Speaker 2:  It was in London

[33:7.20 - 33:9.08] Speaker 2:  And he says

[33:9.72 - 33:13.86] Speaker 2:  You know he gave me quite a bit of

[33:13.86 - 33:15.72] Speaker 2:  Whatever he wanted to say

[33:15.72 - 33:17.48] Speaker 2:  Why don't you speak about Palestine

[33:17.48 - 33:18.82] Speaker 2:  And why don't you talk about this

[33:18.82 - 33:19.70] Speaker 2:  And who are you feeling

[33:19.70 - 33:21.64] Speaker 2:  And why don't you mention the enemy

[33:21.64 - 33:23.76] Speaker 2:  And whatever he kept on going on

[33:23.76 - 33:24.44] Speaker 2:  And on and on

[33:24.44 - 33:26.28] Speaker 2:  And you know it's in full view of the public

[33:26.85 - 33:28.69] Speaker 2:  My brother I love you

[33:28.69 - 33:29.81] Speaker 2:  We all came for Palestine

[33:29.81 - 33:31.85] Speaker 2:  We all know who the criminals are

[33:31.85 - 33:32.63] Speaker 2:  We all know whatever

[33:32.63 - 33:33.75] Speaker 2:  We've done a lot

[33:33.75 - 33:34.61] Speaker 2:  Whatever we could

[33:34.61 - 33:35.77] Speaker 2:  We know what we've said

[33:35.77 - 33:36.87] Speaker 2:  We know what we've spoken

[33:36.87 - 33:38.75] Speaker 2:  We know we've called it to genocide

[33:38.75 - 33:39.69] Speaker 2:  We know every

[33:39.69 - 33:41.53] Speaker 2:  We know a lot

[33:41.53 - 33:43.87] Speaker 2:  And we've done more than your imagination

[33:43.87 - 33:45.23] Speaker 2:  And I'm not doing it for you

[33:45.23 - 33:46.51] Speaker 2:  Anyone doing it for Allah

[33:46.51 - 33:48.35] Speaker 2:  I know all of this in my mind

[33:48.35 - 33:50.69] Speaker 2:  But he's an elderly man

[33:50.69 - 33:52.13] Speaker 2:  I let him have his peace

[33:52.13 - 33:53.37] Speaker 2:  And I stopped

[33:53.37 - 33:55.33] Speaker 2:  And there were people walking with me

[33:55.33 - 33:56.63] Speaker 2:  Like almost like bodyguards

[33:56.63 - 33:58.05] Speaker 2:  I said no no no move away

[33:58.05 - 33:59.83] Speaker 2:  This man let's listen to what he has to say

[33:59.83 - 34:0.65] Speaker 2:  I'll really man

[34:0.65 - 34:1.95] Speaker 2:  And he said his peace

[34:1.95 - 34:2.73] Speaker 2:  I said uncle

[34:5.13 - 34:6.85] Speaker 2:  Well like do you really think we don't care

[34:7.49 - 34:8.49] Speaker 2:  Do you trust me

[34:8.49 - 34:10.01] Speaker 2:  If you don't trust me don't follow me

[34:10.01 - 34:11.13] Speaker 2:  Don't listen to me

[34:11.13 - 34:12.45] Speaker 2:  Kick me out of your own vocab

[34:12.45 - 34:13.13] Speaker 2:  It's okay

[34:13.59 - 34:14.81] Speaker 2:  But you trust me

[34:14.81 - 34:15.85] Speaker 2:  If you trust me

[34:15.85 - 34:19.23] Speaker 2:  Trust the fact that I am doing whatever I can

[34:19.23 - 34:21.35] Speaker 2:  Maybe not exactly how you wanted

[34:21.35 - 34:23.31] Speaker 2:  But I know what I'm doing

[34:23.37 - 34:25.69] Speaker 2:  And I know things you don't know

[34:25.69 - 34:28.17] Speaker 2:  And I have done things you wouldn't imagine

[34:28.17 - 34:29.21] Speaker 2:  I would have done

[34:29.21 - 34:30.27] Speaker 2:  So uncle

[34:30.27 - 34:31.83] Speaker 2:  I want to give you a big hug

[34:31.83 - 34:32.81] Speaker 2:  Because I love you

[34:32.81 - 34:34.33] Speaker 2:  If anything happened to you

[34:34.33 - 34:36.77] Speaker 2:  I would be the first one to defend you

[34:37.28 - 34:38.08] Speaker 2:  He just looked at me

[34:38.08 - 34:38.74] Speaker 2:  I said

[34:42.45 - 34:45.01] Speaker 1:  And he gave me such a big hug

[34:45.01 - 34:46.49] Speaker 1:  Such a big hug

[34:46.49 - 34:48.63] Speaker 1:  It was such a warm experience

[34:48.63 - 34:50.57] Speaker 1:  We had to run away after that

[34:50.57 - 34:51.75] Speaker 1:  But I promised you

[34:51.75 - 34:54.95] Speaker 1:  If I was given a while I would have gone to his place for tea

[34:55.84 - 34:56.36] Speaker 1:  Why?

[34:56.60 - 34:57.80] Speaker 1:  He's a member of the Alma

[34:57.80 - 35:0.00] Speaker 1:  A few bad words he uttered in public

[35:0.00 - 35:1.22] Speaker 1:  I did say to him uncle

[35:1.22 - 35:3.62] Speaker 1:  I don't think I deserve a public and

[35:4.40 - 35:6.76] Speaker 1:  Monitoring in this whole place here

[35:6.76 - 35:6.98] Speaker 1:  You know

[35:6.98 - 35:8.06] Speaker 1:  But we started laughing

[35:8.06 - 35:9.54] Speaker 1:  And we were okay and we walked out

[35:9.54 - 35:11.00] Speaker 1:  Because we members of the Alma

[35:11.00 - 35:14.28] Speaker 1:  We are all frustrated about what's going on

[35:14.28 - 35:15.48] Speaker 1:  In Palestine

[35:15.48 - 35:16.28] Speaker 1:  And in Lebanon

[35:16.72 - 35:18.32] Speaker 1:  And this we are frustrated

[35:18.32 - 35:19.78] Speaker 1:  But trust me

[35:19.78 - 35:21.04] Speaker 1:  In that frustration

[35:21.04 - 35:23.20] Speaker 1:  Don't start fighting each other

[35:23.20 - 35:25.34] Speaker 1:  Because that's the whole aim of the enemy

[35:26.20 - 35:29.60] Speaker 1:  They will make sure you believe

[35:29.60 - 35:31.22] Speaker 1:  That others are not doing anything

[35:31.22 - 35:33.50] Speaker 1:  When all of us are doing whatever we can

[35:33.50 - 35:35.98] Speaker 1:  Different capacities you may never know

[35:35.98 - 35:37.86] Speaker 1:  People say why don't you talk about Palestine

[35:37.86 - 35:40.56] Speaker 1:  Allah he has spoken about it so many times

[35:40.56 - 35:42.08] Speaker 1:  Including today

[35:43.52 - 35:44.72] Speaker 1:  Subhanallah

[35:44.85 - 35:46.89] Speaker 1:  You don't follow to you

[35:46.89 - 35:48.75] Speaker 1:  So you only hear what people say

[35:48.75 - 35:50.57] Speaker 1:  Or you don't know

[35:50.67 - 35:53.01] Speaker 1:  What they've deleted from the post

[35:53.01 - 35:56.19] Speaker 1:  That I've posted and when they've banned me

[35:56.19 - 35:57.75] Speaker 1:  And how long they've banned me for it

[35:57.75 - 36:1.11] Speaker 1:  I don't need to see something from you

[36:1.11 - 36:3.37] Speaker 1:  To know that you are a member of the Alma

[36:3.37 - 36:4.45] Speaker 1:  You are doing something

[36:4.45 - 36:7.25] Speaker 1:  I believe it without seeing it

[36:7.25 - 36:8.99] Speaker 1:  There is no member of the Alma

[36:8.99 - 36:11.31] Speaker 1:  That doesn't care for the rest of the Alma

[36:11.31 - 36:11.89] Speaker 1:  No way

[36:11.89 - 36:12.79] Speaker 1:  We have differences

[36:12.79 - 36:14.33] Speaker 1:  We will have so many differences

[36:14.33 - 36:15.25] Speaker 1:  But trust me

[36:15.25 - 36:17.51] Speaker 1:  The good thing is deep down

[36:17.51 - 36:18.71] Speaker 1:  We do care

[36:18.71 - 36:20.61] Speaker 1:  May Allah Almighty help us

[36:20.61 - 36:23.63] Speaker 1:  Don't allow Shaitan to snatch away

[36:23.63 - 36:26.63] Speaker 1:  The care that you have within your heart

[36:26.63 - 36:28.47] Speaker 1:  Simply because you think

[36:28.47 - 36:30.41] Speaker 1:  Oh this person belongs to that sect

[36:30.41 - 36:32.13] Speaker 1:  And this person belongs to that sect

[36:32.13 - 36:34.27] Speaker 1:  And so when we go out to help

[36:34.27 - 36:35.87] Speaker 1:  Allah has given us an example

[36:35.87 - 36:37.19] Speaker 1:  Through the life of Nabi Muhammad

[36:37.19 - 36:38.43] Speaker 1:  Allah's Solomon's words

[36:38.43 - 36:40.57] Speaker 1:  To say a man entered paradise

[36:40.57 - 36:43.97] Speaker 1:  By assisting a dog in quenching its thirst

[36:44.16 - 36:46.02] Speaker 1:  Was the dog from your sect?

[36:47.37 - 36:49.41] Speaker 1:  Was the dog from your tribe from your race?

[36:49.99 - 36:50.83] Speaker 1:  Why was it a dog?

[36:50.83 - 36:53.49] Speaker 1:  To show you that if he earned paradise

[36:53.49 - 36:54.55] Speaker 1:  Through the dog

[36:54.83 - 36:58.53] Speaker 1:  What would you earn through a human being?

[37:0.03 - 37:0.73] Speaker 1:  Subhan Allah

[37:0.73 - 37:2.07] Speaker 1:  That's the message

[37:2.68 - 37:5.18] Speaker 1:  And on Kay what where you are and what

[37:5.18 - 37:8.16] Speaker 1:  I will even go as far as assisting the non-Muslims

[37:8.16 - 37:8.96] Speaker 1:  When they are in need

[37:8.96 - 37:10.02] Speaker 1:  We will do it

[37:10.02 - 37:10.58] Speaker 1:  Won't we?

[37:10.62 - 37:11.74] Speaker 1:  Haven't we done it already?

[37:13.22 - 37:14.28] Speaker 1:  We will go and help

[37:14.28 - 37:17.90] Speaker 1:  We are not doing it because we think they deserve our help

[37:17.90 - 37:20.30] Speaker 1:  We are doing it because Allah told us to help

[37:20.30 - 37:21.10] Speaker 1:  That's it

[37:21.10 - 37:23.78] Speaker 1:  I don't care whether you like me or you don't like me

[37:23.78 - 37:24.60] Speaker 1:  I will help you

[37:24.60 - 37:25.28] Speaker 1:  It's okay

[37:25.28 - 37:26.84] Speaker 1:  That's the attitude of a believer

[37:29.14 - 37:30.30] Speaker 2:  You can hate me

[37:30.30 - 37:31.32] Speaker 2:  But the day you need me

[37:31.32 - 37:33.76] Speaker 2:  I will stop and try and save your life

[37:33.92 - 37:35.24] Speaker 2:  I will help you

[37:35.24 - 37:36.50] Speaker 2:  Change your tire

[37:36.50 - 37:37.14] Speaker 2:  Puncher

[37:37.14 - 37:39.42] Speaker 2:  Even if you are swearing me while I am doing it

[37:39.42 - 37:39.86] Speaker 2:  So what?

[37:40.12 - 37:41.22] Speaker 2:  Man has a problem

[37:41.22 - 37:44.08] Speaker 2:  We would not like to help people who don't like us

[37:46.43 - 37:48.59] Speaker 1:  Try to get one above that

[37:48.59 - 37:49.11] Speaker 1:  It's okay

[37:49.11 - 37:50.15] Speaker 1:  You don't like me

[37:50.15 - 37:51.63] Speaker 1:  I'm not helping you because of you

[37:51.63 - 37:53.29] Speaker 1:  I'm helping you because Allah says

[37:53.29 - 37:54.55] Speaker 1:  Allah who you hate

[37:54.55 - 37:57.33] Speaker 1:  Allah loves those who do good

[37:57.33 - 37:59.65] Speaker 1:  My good deed is for Allah not for you

[37:59.85 - 38:1.01] Speaker 1:  I'm going to do good

[38:2.09 - 38:5.51] Speaker 1:  So when Allah sends Adam Alayhi Selam here

[38:5.67 - 38:7.31] Speaker 1:  He started having children

[38:7.73 - 38:9.73] Speaker 1:  And when he started having children

[38:9.73 - 38:10.53] Speaker 1:  Subhan Allah

[38:11.79 - 38:14.49] Speaker 1:  There was a special system with which

[38:14.49 - 38:17.17] Speaker 1:  The children ended up getting married

[38:17.17 - 38:18.69] Speaker 1:  From different wounds

[38:18.69 - 38:21.61] Speaker 1:  One narration states that they were 20

[38:21.61 - 38:25.07] Speaker 1:  20 times when HaWa Alayhi Selam gave birth

[38:25.20 - 38:27.58] Speaker 1:  Each time she had a boy and a girl

[38:27.58 - 38:29.84] Speaker 1:  So the law at the time

[38:29.84 - 38:32.98] Speaker 1:  The rule at the time was anyone born in one womb

[38:32.98 - 38:34.58] Speaker 1:  Was not allowed to marry each other

[38:34.58 - 38:35.92] Speaker 1:  They were considered the siblings

[38:35.92 - 38:38.88] Speaker 1:  And the others were allowed to marry

[38:38.88 - 38:40.48] Speaker 1:  For the first generation

[38:40.48 - 38:41.74] Speaker 1:  And then it changed

[38:41.74 - 38:44.86] Speaker 1:  So each time the shariah or the law changed

[38:44.86 - 38:46.18] Speaker 1:  Right at the beginning

[38:46.18 - 38:48.64] Speaker 1:  You were allowed to marry a person

[38:48.64 - 38:51.34] Speaker 1:  Who was not born in the same womb as you

[38:51.34 - 38:53.90] Speaker 1:  So you had at least another 18 people

[38:53.90 - 38:55.12] Speaker 1:  You could get married to

[38:55.12 - 38:57.12] Speaker 1:  Meaning 18 divided by two

[38:57.12 - 38:58.14] Speaker 1:  Because boys and girls

[38:58.14 - 38:59.28] Speaker 1:  9

[39:0.66 - 39:1.76] Speaker 1:  Subhan Allah

[39:1.92 - 39:3.92] Speaker 1:  And then it carried on from there

[39:3.92 - 39:5.86] Speaker 1:  And it became further

[39:5.86 - 39:6.56] Speaker 1:  And further

[39:7.37 - 39:8.15] Speaker 1:  And what happened

[39:8.15 - 39:9.61] Speaker 1:  They were brothers

[39:9.61 - 39:10.65] Speaker 1:  They started fighting

[39:10.65 - 39:12.51] Speaker 1:  The same shaytan came in

[39:12.51 - 39:13.83] Speaker 1:  They were brothers

[39:13.83 - 39:16.23] Speaker 1:  The same shaytan came in

[39:16.23 - 39:18.43] Speaker 1:  He made them go to war

[39:18.59 - 39:20.29] Speaker 1:  He made them fight each other

[39:20.29 - 39:21.77] Speaker 1:  And as the generations went

[39:22.47 - 39:23.75] Speaker 1:  They lost

[39:24.45 - 39:26.99] Speaker 1:  They lost the whole

[39:28.50 - 39:31.72] Speaker 1:  Reality of the fact that they are all brothers and one

[39:33.23 - 39:34.87] Speaker 1:  So what did Allah do?

[39:36.06 - 39:36.76] Speaker 1:  In a nutshell

[39:36.76 - 39:39.02] Speaker 1:  He kept sending prophets to remind them

[39:40.38 - 39:43.00] Speaker 1:  Every prophet reminded them

[39:43.06 - 39:46.56] Speaker 1:  To fulfill the rights of family and relatives

[39:47.39 - 39:50.27] Speaker 1:  It doesn't mean the others must not be fulfilled

[39:50.27 - 39:52.89] Speaker 1:  But family and relatives have a greater right

[39:54.53 - 39:55.49] Speaker 1:  Everyone

[39:56.64 - 39:58.54] Speaker 1:  Allah tells us

[39:58.54 - 39:59.50] Speaker 1:  In the Quran

[39:59.50 - 40:0.96] Speaker 1:  So many times

[40:3.04 - 40:4.68] Speaker 2:  To be conscious of your family

[40:4.68 - 40:5.42] Speaker 2:  Members why?

[40:5.52 - 40:6.56] Speaker 2:  Because it's not easy

[40:6.56 - 40:8.06] Speaker 2:  You will have problems

[40:8.06 - 40:10.08] Speaker 2:  You will have issues with your brother

[40:10.08 - 40:11.16] Speaker 2:  With your sister

[40:11.16 - 40:12.32] Speaker 2:  With your in laws

[40:12.32 - 40:13.44] Speaker 2:  With whoever else

[40:13.44 - 40:15.30] Speaker 2:  With your brothers in laws

[40:15.30 - 40:16.68] Speaker 2:  With your sisters in law

[40:16.68 - 40:18.16] Speaker 2:  Whatever it might be

[40:18.16 - 40:19.38] Speaker 2:  You will have issues

[40:19.38 - 40:22.46] Speaker 2:  That is just Allah trying to look at you

[40:22.46 - 40:24.32] Speaker 2:  Whether giving you an opportunity

[40:24.32 - 40:26.12] Speaker 2:  Actually to shine

[40:26.31 - 40:27.75] Speaker 2:  How are you going to shine

[40:27.75 - 40:30.15] Speaker 2:  So what is it about?

[40:30.85 - 40:31.39] Speaker 2:  It's okay

[40:31.39 - 40:32.01] Speaker 2:  Let's solve it

[40:32.01 - 40:32.77] Speaker 2:  Let's sit and talk

[40:32.77 - 40:33.91] Speaker 2:  Let's sit again and talk

[40:33.91 - 40:35.39] Speaker 2:  Let's sit ten times and talk

[40:35.39 - 40:36.39] Speaker 2:  And try and resolve it

[40:36.39 - 40:36.91] Speaker 2:  Given take

[40:36.91 - 40:37.55] Speaker 2:  It's okay

[40:38.03 - 40:39.73] Speaker 2:  Sometimes I have said I'm sorry

[40:39.73 - 40:41.71] Speaker 2:  When I know that I was not wrong

[40:42.03 - 40:42.65] Speaker 2:  Guess what?

[40:42.85 - 40:43.83] Speaker 2:  It works wonders

[40:43.83 - 40:45.05] Speaker 2:  Try it

[40:45.05 - 40:46.83] Speaker 2:  I don't mean give up your rights

[40:46.83 - 40:49.35] Speaker 2:  But something that maybe is very

[40:50.28 - 40:51.24] Speaker 2:  Dear to you

[40:51.24 - 40:52.94] Speaker 2:  You might want to stand up a bit for justice

[40:53.38 - 40:53.88] Speaker 2:  Because yes

[40:53.88 - 40:55.86] Speaker 2:  Justice is something that Islam teaches

[40:56.24 - 40:57.66] Speaker 2:  But when it's your own family

[40:57.66 - 40:59.12] Speaker 2:  And it's a thing that's forgivable

[40:59.50 - 41:0.76] Speaker 2:  Forgive it, leave it

[41:0.76 - 41:1.78] Speaker 2:  You know what?

[41:1.78 - 41:3.38] Speaker 2:  You have bigger fish to fry

[41:3.44 - 41:5.38] Speaker 2:  You have bigger issues

[41:5.38 - 41:8.38] Speaker 2:  And I want to tell you something very serious tonight

[41:9.12 - 41:11.62] Speaker 2:  Ask those who know

[41:12.23 - 41:14.11] Speaker 2:  When you carry burdens

[41:14.11 - 41:15.29] Speaker 2:  And you have hate

[41:15.29 - 41:18.25] Speaker 2:  And you have so much of dirt in your heart

[41:18.25 - 41:22.35] Speaker 2:  You will never ever lead a happy life

[41:22.35 - 41:24.03] Speaker 2:  You will be unwell

[41:24.03 - 41:25.77] Speaker 2:  You will be sick and ill

[41:25.77 - 41:28.35] Speaker 2:  Your mind will get even more fulfilled

[41:28.35 - 41:29.95] Speaker 2:  With hurt and hate and dirt

[41:29.95 - 41:33.31] Speaker 2:  And you will not be content at all

[41:33.31 - 41:36.61] Speaker 2:  Because your heart is not ready to receive content

[41:36.61 - 41:37.93] Speaker 2:  That's why

[41:38.21 - 41:41.53] Speaker 2:  When you have a heart that is clean and good

[41:42.12 - 41:44.32] Speaker 2:  You might be trampled a little bit here and there

[41:44.32 - 41:45.82] Speaker 2:  But trust me you will be content

[41:45.82 - 41:46.98] Speaker 2:  You have a contentment

[41:46.98 - 41:47.24] Speaker 2:  Why?

[41:47.68 - 41:48.76] Speaker 2:  You have a connection with Allah

[41:48.76 - 41:50.92] Speaker 2:  And you know I'm just going to do my best

[41:50.92 - 41:54.96] Speaker 2:  So do not allow your heart to be filled with hate

[41:54.96 - 41:56.68] Speaker 2:  And jealousy and ill feeling

[41:56.68 - 41:58.02] Speaker 2:  You will burn

[41:58.02 - 41:59.10] Speaker 2:  You will burn

[41:59.10 - 42:2.40] Speaker 2:  And your contentment will be thrown out of the window

[42:2.40 - 42:3.96] Speaker 2:  If you want to taste contentment

[42:4.68 - 42:5.42] Speaker 2:  Have a good heart

[42:5.42 - 42:6.50] Speaker 2:  Be happy for people

[42:6.50 - 42:7.58] Speaker 2:  You have a business

[42:7.58 - 42:7.96] Speaker 2:  Mashallah

[42:8.60 - 42:9.42] Speaker 2:  You made a million

[42:9.42 - 42:10.86] Speaker 2:  Guess what a guy right next door

[42:10.86 - 42:11.92] Speaker 2:  Open the same business

[42:11.92 - 42:12.94] Speaker 2:  What am I going to do?

[42:13.34 - 42:15.78] Speaker 2:  If you get, if you are enraged

[42:16.75 - 42:19.59] Speaker 2:  You will only suffer in your rage

[42:20.29 - 42:23.25] Speaker 2:  You might want to develop a relation with the person

[42:23.25 - 42:24.45] Speaker 2:  One of those things

[42:24.45 - 42:26.51] Speaker 2:  You might want to thank Allah

[42:26.51 - 42:28.63] Speaker 2:  You might want to move from there

[42:28.76 - 42:31.06] Speaker 2:  But if that person is doing something legal

[42:31.06 - 42:32.82] Speaker 2:  You will say, oh Allah

[42:32.82 - 42:34.18] Speaker 2:  Up to today

[42:34.18 - 42:36.20] Speaker 2:  You have looked after me

[42:36.20 - 42:37.50] Speaker 2:  You've given me sustenance

[42:37.50 - 42:38.66] Speaker 2:  Now I have a neighbor

[42:38.66 - 42:42.22] Speaker 2:  I know you will never give one penny

[42:42.22 - 42:43.80] Speaker 2:  written for me to that person

[42:45.06 - 42:45.62] Speaker 2:  Subhanallah

[42:45.62 - 42:47.32] Speaker 2:  I'm going to work hard

[42:47.32 - 42:48.42] Speaker 2:  I will have offers

[42:48.42 - 42:50.92] Speaker 2:  I will try and we will have a decent relationship

[42:50.92 - 42:52.96] Speaker 2:  Why break a relationship with that person

[42:52.96 - 42:55.00] Speaker 2:  When you go to the Middle East and some places

[42:55.00 - 42:57.16] Speaker 2:  When you find a mobile phone store

[42:57.16 - 42:57.80] Speaker 2:  For example

[42:57.80 - 42:59.58] Speaker 2:  How many of them are all together?

[43:0.36 - 43:1.22] Speaker 2:  The whole mall

[43:1.79 - 43:4.55] Speaker 2:  The whole mall is full of all stores

[43:4.55 - 43:6.67] Speaker 2:  That are selling exactly the same thing

[43:6.67 - 43:9.93] Speaker 2:  You find cloaks or thobes or captains

[43:9.93 - 43:11.05] Speaker 2:  Or whatever it might be

[43:11.05 - 43:12.97] Speaker 2:  You find about 50 little stalls

[43:12.97 - 43:14.11] Speaker 2:  Or even big ones

[43:14.11 - 43:15.77] Speaker 2:  And all of them are making their money

[43:16.43 - 43:17.95] Speaker 2:  It's only us sometimes

[43:17.95 - 43:19.15] Speaker 2:  What happens with us

[43:19.15 - 43:20.81] Speaker 2:  We start getting angry and upset

[43:20.81 - 43:21.23] Speaker 2:  You know what?

[43:21.23 - 43:22.47] Speaker 2:  You're just going to lose your content

[43:23.13 - 43:23.95] Speaker 2:  If anything

[43:24.63 - 43:25.75] Speaker 2:  Do the opposite

[43:25.75 - 43:26.59] Speaker 2:  Pray for them

[43:26.59 - 43:27.45] Speaker 2:  Oh Allah grant them

[43:27.89 - 43:29.17] Speaker 2:  And bless me

[43:29.23 - 43:30.07] Speaker 2:  Make a relation

[43:30.07 - 43:31.27] Speaker 2:  If you want to

[43:31.27 - 43:32.27] Speaker 2:  If you don't want you

[43:32.27 - 43:34.05] Speaker 2:  You may not be a human at the end of the day

[43:34.05 - 43:35.43] Speaker 2:  But clean your heart

[43:35.43 - 43:36.81] Speaker 2:  Trust Allah

[43:36.81 - 43:38.47] Speaker 2:  He will look after you

[43:39.53 - 43:40.27] Speaker 2:  So Adam Alayhi

[43:40.27 - 43:41.23] Speaker 2:  Salam's children

[43:41.23 - 43:42.21] Speaker 2:  As they came

[43:42.21 - 43:44.37] Speaker 2:  I want to end off by telling you

[43:44.37 - 43:45.95] Speaker 2:  And this is a long subject

[43:45.95 - 43:47.79] Speaker 2:  Perhaps I might continue tomorrow

[43:47.79 - 43:48.63] Speaker 2:  In Glosta

[43:48.63 - 43:54.49] Speaker 2:  As they grew in number

[43:54.49 - 43:56.49] Speaker 2:  They became more and more distant

[43:56.87 - 43:59.95] Speaker 2:  If you allow a problem

[43:59.95 - 44:2.01] Speaker 2:  That you have with your brother

[44:3.00 - 44:6.59] Speaker 2:  To filter through to your children who are cousins

[44:7.53 - 44:10.01] Speaker 2:  Within a generation or two

[44:10.01 - 44:13.00] Speaker 2:  There will be two massive warring factions

[44:13.21 - 44:15.27] Speaker 2:  Yet they were brothers

[44:15.27 - 44:16.95] Speaker 2:  Don't allow it

[44:16.95 - 44:18.35] Speaker 2:  Solve it while you can

[44:18.35 - 44:19.65] Speaker 2:  Don't ever say

[44:19.65 - 44:22.19] Speaker 2:  I don't want you to go to your cousin's house

[44:22.19 - 44:24.79] Speaker 2:  Or unless there's something very toxic

[44:24.79 - 44:26.71] Speaker 2:  But try to solve the matter

[44:26.71 - 44:28.19] Speaker 2:  Talk about it

[44:28.19 - 44:29.01] Speaker 2:  Raise the issue

[44:29.01 - 44:30.41] Speaker 2:  And don't say they are bad

[44:30.41 - 44:30.97] Speaker 2:  They are evil

[44:30.97 - 44:33.47] Speaker 2:  Because you are training innocent kids

[44:33.47 - 44:34.53] Speaker 2:  Into believing

[44:34.53 - 44:36.45] Speaker 2:  That their own cousins are evil

[44:36.45 - 44:37.23] Speaker 2:  People yet

[44:37.23 - 44:39.27] Speaker 2:  You are going to need them

[44:39.27 - 44:40.99] Speaker 2:  You are not alone on earth

[44:40.99 - 44:43.13] Speaker 2:  You can't survive alone on earth

[44:43.13 - 44:44.45] Speaker 2:  Allah created you and says

[44:44.45 - 44:46.37] Speaker 2:  You are not alone on earth

[44:46.37 - 44:48.03] Speaker 2:  Don't forget to be virtuous

[44:48.03 - 44:48.99] Speaker 2:  To one another

[44:48.99 - 44:50.27] Speaker 2:  The reason is

[44:50.27 - 44:51.63] Speaker 2:  Allah created you

[44:52.27 - 44:52.87] Speaker 2:  Interdependent

[44:52.87 - 44:53.63] Speaker 2:  You know what that means

[44:53.99 - 44:55.71] Speaker 2:  I depend on Allah for my income

[44:56.11 - 44:59.33] Speaker 2:  But Allah has facilitated that income

[44:59.33 - 45:0.81] Speaker 2:  Through other people

[45:0.81 - 45:2.35] Speaker 2:  They will come to my business

[45:2.35 - 45:3.73] Speaker 2:  They will employ me

[45:3.73 - 45:5.17] Speaker 2:  They will deal with me

[45:5.17 - 45:8.45] Speaker 2:  And that given take is what will make me survive on earth

[45:9.68 - 45:11.02] Speaker 2:  Without that given take

[45:11.02 - 45:12.36] Speaker 2:  I am not going to survive

[45:12.42 - 45:14.36] Speaker 2:  So bear this in mind

[45:14.36 - 45:16.26] Speaker 2:  Don't let patties

[45:16.26 - 45:18.10] Speaker 2:  Drift you apart

[45:18.10 - 45:19.80] Speaker 2:  Be a good Muslim

[45:20.36 - 45:23.04] Speaker 2:  A good Muslim is one who understands

[45:23.04 - 45:25.98] Speaker 2:  Whenever we make a mistake or wherever we've sinned

[45:25.98 - 45:27.00] Speaker 2:  Wherever we've gone wrong

[45:27.00 - 45:28.48] Speaker 2:  We're going to come back to Allah again

[45:28.48 - 45:29.38] Speaker 2:  And again

[45:29.38 - 45:30.76] Speaker 2:  On the day of judgement

[45:30.76 - 45:34.22] Speaker 2:  One of the most beautiful things Allah has done for us

[45:34.22 - 45:37.32] Speaker 2:  Is that he's kept a scale to weigh the deeds

[45:37.32 - 45:38.36] Speaker 2:  Have you ever thought of that?

[45:39.36 - 45:41.60] Speaker 2:  If Allah wanted he could punish you for your bad deeds

[45:41.60 - 45:42.22] Speaker 2:  Straight

[45:42.22 - 45:43.10] Speaker 2:  Straight

[45:43.10 - 45:43.96] Speaker 2:  He's still can

[45:43.96 - 45:45.36] Speaker 2:  But Allah says

[45:45.36 - 45:46.70] Speaker 2:  When Allah wills him
